# # About Me
My name is Jessica Caruso and I live in Tampa, Florida. I received my bachelor’s in political science at the University of Central Florida. During my senior year at UCF, I began working as a Legislative Assistant at the Florida Senate. Within the same year, I decided to continue working on my education and attend the University of Florida CJC to pursue a master’s degree in political communications. 

After working for the Florida Senate for a year, I worked a short six months as the Government Relations Director at the Public Defender’s Office of the 6th Judicial Circuit. Now, in my current role, I serve as a Public Affairs Coordinator at the Florida Attorney General’s Office. I thoroughly enjoy working in state politics and have a strong understanding of the process from working at the state legislative, judicial, and executive branches. I really enjoy playing volleyball and spending time at the beach. I grew up in a small southern town in Illinois—our town had “drive your own tractor” to school day in high school. It should also come at no surprise that I am a lover of country music and all things outdoors!
